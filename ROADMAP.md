# SSL Store — Improvement Roadmap

> A gold/jewelry store app (buy / sell / pawn / gold-savings / wallet / appointments) built on Flutter + Firebase.
> Goal: evolve it steadily into something solid enough to run a real home business on.
>
> **How to use this:** Each day, pick the top unchecked `[ ]` task in the current milestone, do it, check it off, commit. Tasks are sized to fit roughly one sitting. Don't skip ahead — earlier milestones make later work safe.

**Status legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done
**Last assessed:** 2026-06-10 (against commit `8f42523`) · `flutter analyze`: **28 issues** · largest file: `owner_overview_tab.dart` (1,508 lines)

> **Note:** A large refactor (commit `8f42523`) already completed the original security and service-split work. This roadmap reflects the *current* state, not the original assessment.

---

## ✅ Already done (was in the original plan)
- **Firestore security rules hardened** — auth required everywhere, role-based owner checks via `/roles` mirror, per-user ownership, append-only event/history logs, default-deny catch-all. (was Milestone 0)
- **God service split** — `mock_service.dart` (2,493 lines) replaced by 9 focused services: catalog, pawn, savings, trading, market, notification, appointment, user, inventory-lot. (was Milestone 3)
- **Files renamed to convention** (`member_*_page.dart`, `owner_*`) and most dead code removed. (was Milestone 1)
- `flutter analyze` down from 195 → 28 issues.

## 🧹 Milestone A — Tidy the repo ✅ DONE (2026-06-10)

Small loose ends from the big refactor. Low effort, removes noise.

- [x] **Remove `lib.zip` from the repo** (227 KB binary backup) and add `*.zip` to `.gitignore`. Source backups don't belong in git.
- [x] **Decide on `users.json`** — was a Firebase Auth export (test user + password hash); deleted and gitignored.
- [x] **Move design docs into a `docs/` folder** — `database_design_academic_review.md`, `firebase_database_assessment.md`, `ssl_store_firestore_er*.xml`, `UC10_appointment_management.xml`. Root is clean.
- [x] **Finish the analyzer mop-up (28 → 0).** Fixed `use_build_context_synchronously` (used `context.mounted`), `curly_braces`, `unnecessary_cast`, unused imports/fields, etc. Renaming the `TransactionType` enum was avoided (values persist as Firestore strings) — suppressed with a documented `ignore`. **`flutter analyze`: No issues found.**

---

## 🟢 Milestone B — Trust the money (testing) — IN PROGRESS

Foundation laid; **52 tests passing, `flutter test` green, no network/emulator needed.**

**Infra decision:** using `fake_cloud_firestore` (in-memory) for business-logic
tests instead of the live emulator — faster, deterministic, CI-friendly. The
real emulator is reserved for *security-rules* testing (Milestone C). See
`test/README.md`.

- [x] ~~Set up the Firebase emulator~~ → chose `fake_cloud_firestore` + `firebase_auth_mocks` for logic tests (emulator deferred to rules testing in Milestone C).
- [x] **Unit-test pawn interest** (`gold_asset.dart`, 1.25%/month accrual) — not-pawned/zero-day/30-day/60-day/custom-rate cases.
- [x] **Unit-test labor-fee / pricing** logic — every tier & boundary across all 6 categories (Thai + English). **Found & fixed a bug:** `'earring'.contains('ring')` made earrings get ring fees.
- [x] **Unit-test wallet** (`wallet_service.dart`) — deposit/sale credit, withdrawal/purchase debit, insufficient-funds, exact-balance boundary, **atomic rollback**, cumulative running balance, streams. (Made `WalletService` + `IdGeneratorService` injectable.)
- [x] **Money-model round-trips** — `Wallet` / `WalletTransaction` toMap↔fromFirestore, int→double coercion, unknown-enum fallback.
- [x] **Replace placeholder `widget_test.dart`** — now a real `GoldRateCard` render test (full app-boot test needs Firebase Core mocks; deferred).
- [x] **Make `TradingService` injectable** — factory-injection pattern (no-arg call still returns the production singleton). Also made `InventoryLotService` and the `getUserDocRef` helper injectable.
- [x] **Integration-test the buy & sell flows** (`trading_service.dart`) — market-rate & FIFO cost basis, wallet debit, stock + lot draw-down, asset creation, ledger row, reward points; insufficient-funds & out-of-stock both reject atomically (no side effects); sell credits wallet, soft-deletes asset, records profit. **59 tests total.**
- [ ] **Make `SavingsService` injectable + integration-test** deposit/withdraw round-trip (THB→weight→THB).
- [ ] **Unit-test `pawn_service.dart`** pawn/redeem flow once injectable.

---

## 🟠 Milestone C — Visibility (errors & logging)

Make failures visible so future changes don't silently break money flows.

- [ ] **Add Crashlytics + a logger package**; report caught errors instead of swallowing them.
- [ ] **Audit `catch` blocks** across the 9 services for silent failures; log or surface them.
- [ ] **Verify security rules with the emulator** — confirm a member account cannot read another member's wallet/assets (the rules look right; prove it with a test).

---

## 🟡 Milestone D — Slim the screens (architecture, round 2)

The services are clean now, but the pages are still huge — logic and Firestore wiring live in the UI. Shrink them with tests (Milestone B) as a safety net.

- [ ] **`owner_overview_tab.dart` (1,508)** — extract calculations/queries into the owner/services layer; the widget should mostly render.
- [ ] **`member_trading_page.dart` (1,471)** — move buy/sell/pawn orchestration into `trading_service` / `pawn_service`.
- [ ] **`member_gold_savings_page.dart` (1,362)** — move deposit/withdraw math into `savings_service`.
- [ ] **`owner_products_page.dart` (1,178)** and **`member_portfolio_page.dart` (1,015)** — same treatment.
- [ ] **Consider a state-management layer** (Riverpod) once pages are thinner — pilot on the gold-rate stream first.
- [ ] **Centralize config** — interest rate, labor-fee tiers, fallback prices into one `AppConfig` / Firestore `config` doc.

---

## 🔵 Milestone E — Make it grow (features & UX)

Once the foundation holds. Reorder freely based on what the shop needs.

- [ ] **Push notifications (FCM)** — remind customers when a pawn is due/overdue.
- [ ] **Offline support** — Firestore persistence for flaky in-shop wifi.
- [ ] **Receipt / transaction export** (PDF or share sheet).
- [ ] **Input validation everywhere** — weights, prices, phone, password strength before writes.
- [ ] **English localization** alongside Thai (`intl` already present).
- [ ] **Owner: low-stock alerts** + end-of-day sales summary.
- [ ] **Scheduled Firestore backups** so business data is never lost.

## Ongoing habits (every working session)
- Commit small and often, with a clear message.
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing; keep the count at/near 0.
- When you touch a feature, add or update a test for it.
- Update this file: check off what's done, add what you discover.
